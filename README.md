A self-hosted gallery for power users.

The goal behind Pixel is to provide a way for user's to manage their own image collections in an **efficient**, and **privacy-focused** way. Websites such as Imgur and Instagram do exist, and one of the over-arching goals of this software is to provide replacements to all of them:

## Personal Image Galleries

The number one feature, is the ability to host private image galleries. The current goal (and roadmap) for this:

- [ ] Upload Images from Any Device
- [ ] Upload Images in Bulk (as .zip files or tracked collections)
- [ ] Group Images using Categories and Tagging
- [ ] Optionally Analyze Images for smart filtering (NSFW detection, Scenery Detection, Face Detection)

## Instagram

User's accounts are able to publish an Instagram-like feed. The feed by default is disabled, but can be shown in four different privacy modes:

* Public (Anyone can see it)
* Friends Only (Only friends can see it)
* Private (Only the user themselves can see it)
* Hidden (Anyone can see it, but the URL is un-published/uncrawleable)

Feature-wise:

- [ ] Upoad Images from Any Device
- [ ] Image Commenting
- [ ] Images can be Tagged
- [ ] Public Images that have Tags (in #hashtag form) go to a public filterable gallery.

## Gallery Subreddit/Booru

Finally, galleries can be created as public forums. This is essentially applying booru (imageboard) like functionality to image subreddits. This allows creating image communities where user's can publicly contribute to image collections, along with the usual moderation like functionality, but with a focus on gallery format.
