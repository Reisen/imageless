# Pixel

An API and front-end for managing large collections of Photos. The aim of the
project is to provide a free self-hosted alternative to image hosting. The
feature set intends to provide some form of all of the following:

- [X] Private Galleries - Akin to Photobucket
- [X] Public Image Feeds - Akin to Instagram
- [X] Public Image Community - Akin to Reddit Imageboards or Boorus
