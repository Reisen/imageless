# A Quick Overview

ðŸŽº Import all your Instagram, Facebook, iPhone, and Google Cloud Images.  
ðŸŽº Quickly discover similar photos and eliminate duplicates.  
ðŸŽº Sort by date, size, and photo content. 
ðŸŽº Analyze image content, and search by text and faces.
ðŸŽº Privacy respecting. Your data is yours, and if you're still worried. Host your own.  

This project exists for my own needs for a private image gallery that isn't
mined 24/7 by various corporations. The goal is relatively simple, provide a
self-hosted gallery and optional Instagram-like social feed for user's who
don't want to upload everything they own to the internet.
